## Update

## Introduction

NRControls: This class is used for using a common controls like alert, action sheet and imagepicker controller with proper completion Handlers. It means when you open the image picker controller you dont worry about implementing the delegate of imagepickercontroller, instead you will get your selected image within the same line of code in completion handler. This library mainly contains the five methods which are for following purpose:
1) Imagepicker controller
2) AlertView
3) Action Sheet
4) AlertView with textfield (eg. you can use this in case of forgot password and in many more cases.)
5) Take or choose photo which use above methods and gives you the selected image within same line of code with the help of completion handler.
6) Document Picker - You can pick any document from local or cloud from your app.
